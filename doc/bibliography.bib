           This introductory textbook explains how and why probability models
           are applied to scientific fields such as medicine, biology, physics,
           oceanography, economics, and psychology to solve problems about
           stochastic processes. It does not just show how a problem is solved
           but explains why by formulating questions and first steps in the
           solutions. Stochastic Processes is ideal for a course aiming to give
           examples of the wide variety of empirical phenomena for which
           stochastic processes provide mathematical models. It introduces the
           methods of probability model building and provides the reader with
           mathematically sound techniques as well as the ability to further
           study the theory of stochastic processes. Originally published in
           1962, this was the first comprehensive survey of stochastic processes
           requiring only a minimal background in introductory probability
           theory and mathematical analysis. Stochastic Processes continues to
           be unique, with many topics and examples still not discussed in other
           textbooks.}

           Modelling structured multivariate point process data has wide ranging
           applications like understanding neural activity, developing faster
           file access systems and learning dependencies among servers in large
           networks. In this paper, we develop the Poisson network model for
           representing multivariate structured Poisson processes. In our model
           each node of the network represents a Poisson process. The novelty of
           our work is that waiting times of a process are modelled by an
           exponential distribution with a piecewise constant rate function that
           depends on the event counts of its parents in the network in a
           generalised linear way. Our choice of model allows to perform exact
           sampling from arbitrary structures. We adopt a Bayesian approach for
           learning the network structure. Further, we discuss fixed point and
           sampling based approximations for performing inference of rate
           functions in Poisson networks.},

           We introduce the Piecewise-Constant Conditional Intensity Model, a
           model for learning temporal dependencies in event streams.
           We describe a closed-form Bayesian approach to learning these models,
           and describe an importance sampling algorithm for forecasting future
           events using these models, using a proposal distribution based on
           Poisson superposition. We then use synthetic data, supercomputer
           event logs, and web search query logs to illustrate that our learning
           algorithm can efficiently learn nonlinear temporal dependencies, and
           that our importance sampling algorithm can effectively forecast
           future events.},

 title     = {Graphical Models for Marked Point Processes Based on Local
              Independence},
 author    = {Didelez, Vanessa},
 abstract  = {
           A new class of graphical models capturing the dependence structure of
           events that occur in time is proposed. The graphs represent so-called
           local independences, meaning that the intensities of certain types of
           events are independent of some (but not necessarilly all) events in
           the past. This dynamic concept of independence is asymmetric, similar
           to Granger non-causality, so the corresponding local independence
           graphs differ considerably from classical graphical models. Hence a
           new notion of graph separation, which is called Î´-separation, is
           introduced and implications for the underlying model as well as for
           likelihood inference are explored. Benefits regarding facilitation of
           reasoning about and understanding of dynamic dependences as well as
           computational simplifications are discussed.},
